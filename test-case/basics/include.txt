include() includes another template. View doesn't move (unlike languages like Handlebars). HTML inside isn't escaped.

---

<div> <span class="hello"> include("template1") </span> </div>

---
{"value1":"one"}
---
<div><span class=hello><b>Included Template 1: one</b></span></div>

---
{"value1":"one","template1":{"value1":"two"}}
---
<div><span class=hello><b>Included Template 1: one</b></span></div>


---
NEW TEMPLATE: enclosing view works in included templates
---
<div> include("template2") </div>

---
{"rootValue":"ABC","nested":{"rootValue":"XYZ"}}
---
<div><i>Included Template 2: ABC</i></div>


---
NEW TEMPLATE: include() includes uses the current view as the root of the template.
---
<div>
    within(nested) {
        include("template1")
    }
</div>

---
{"nested":{"value1":"two"},"value1":"root"}
---
<div><b>Included Template 1: two</b></div>


---
NEW TEMPLATE: include() doesn't output anything if the template isn't known
---
<div> include("unknown-template") </div>

---
{}
---
<div></div>
