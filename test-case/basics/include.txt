include() includes another template. View doesn't move (unlike languages like Handlebars). HTML inside isn't escaped.

<div> <span class="hello"> include("template1") </span> </div>

---
{"value1":"one"}
---
<div><span class=hello><b>Included Template 1: one</b></span></div>

---
{"value1":"one","template1":{"value1":"two"}}
---
<div><span class=hello><b>Included Template 1: one</b></span></div>
