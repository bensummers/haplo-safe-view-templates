Script tags have a special syntax because they're dangerous. (<script> tags are banned)

---

<head>
    scriptTag("/path/to/x" ? time=time)
</head>

---
{}
---
<head><script src="/path/to/x"></script></head>

---
{"time":1234}
---
<head><script src="/path/to/x?time=1234"></script></head>

---
NEW TEMPLATE: empty urls in <script> tags would be dangerous, so those tags are omitted entirely
---
<head>
    scriptTag(? time=time)
</head>

---
{}
---
<head></head>

---
{"time":5678}
---
<head><script src="?time=5678"></script></head>
