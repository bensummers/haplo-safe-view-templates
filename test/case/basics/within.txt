within() moves view to value, but ignores block if there's no corresponding value in view

---

<div>
    within(abc.def) {
        value
    }
</div>

---

{
    "value": "bad selection of root value",
    "abc": {
        "def": {
            "value": "correct nested value"
        }
    }
}

---

<div>correct nested value</div>

---

{
    "abc": {
    }
}

---

<div></div>
