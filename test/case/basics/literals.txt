Literal HTML text nodes need to be in quotes. (When most non-tag things are inserts, doing it the other way round is noisy)

<div> "Hello" </div>
<span> "A string with a \"quote\"" </span>
<span> "A slash \\" </span>
<div> "And a string with a new\nline" </div>

{}

<div>Hello</div><span>A string with a "quote"</span><span>A slash \</span><div>And a string with a new
line</div>
