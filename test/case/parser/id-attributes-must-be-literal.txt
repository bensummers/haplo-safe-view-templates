PARSE ERROR: id attributes must be string literals, because they're too hard to secure

---
<div id=value></div>

Error at line 1 character 13: id and class attributes must always be a literal string or conditionals choosing between literal strings. Use if()/switch() to determine or whitelist values (using untrusted id/class attributes is likely to introduce client side security bugs). Use unsafeAttributeValue() if you have implemented security checks elsewhere.
